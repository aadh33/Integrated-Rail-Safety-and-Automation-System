🚦 Integrated Rail Safety and Automation System (IRSAS)
An Integrated Rail Safety and Automation System (IRSAS) is a real-time embedded prototype designed to enhance railway safety and efficiency using automated braking, smart railway crossing mechanisms, and platform edge barriers. This system leverages microcontrollers, sensors, and motor drivers to reduce human error, prevent accidents, and modernize conventional railway operations.

🚉 Core Modules
🚧 Automated Braking System
Detects obstacles on the track using ultrasonic sensors and applies brakes automatically using motor driver logic.

🛑 Smart Railway Crossing
Uses IR sensors to detect train arrival and control stepper motor-driven gates, reducing unnecessary gate closures.

🧱 Platform Edge Barrier
Deploys only if the train halts at the station — avoids accidental falls using IR sensors and barrier actuation.
